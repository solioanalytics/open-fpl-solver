## Setting Explanations

  - `horizon`: length of the planning horizon
  - `decay_base`: value assigned to decay rate of expected points
  - `ft_value`: value assigned to the extra free transfer
  - `ft_value_list`: values of rolling FTs in different states, for example: `"ft_value_list": {"2": 2.1, "3": 1.8, "4": 1.5, "5": 1.1}` assigns a value of 2.1 for rolling from 1FT to 2FTs, 1.8 value for rolling from 2FTs to 3FTs, etc...
  - `bench_weights`: weights for each bench position's xpts (0=gk, 1=sub1, etc.)
  - `vcap_weight`: weight for vicecaptain pts in the objective function
  - `ft_use_penalty`: penalty on objective function when an FT is used. This parameter ensures that no future transfer (excluding this GW) is scheduled unless the gain is above this threshold
  - `itb_value`: value assigned to having 1.0 extra budget
  - `itb_loss_per_transfer`: reduction in ITB amount per scheduled transfers in future
  - `no_future_transfer`: `true` or `false` whether you want to plan future transfers or not
  - `no_transfer_last_gws`: the number of gws at the end of the period you want to ban transfers
  - `no_transfer_by_position`: list of positions to not transfer in/out. Valid positions: `["G", "D", "M", "F"]`. E.g. to block out goalkeeper transfers set this option to `["G"]`
  - `force_ft_state_lb`: list of GWs and minimum number of FTs to force to have (format is (GW, state)). For example,`"force_ft_state_lb":[[4,3], [7,2]]` will force solver to have at least 3 FTs in GW4, and 2 FTs in GW7
  - `force_ft_state_ub`: list of GWs and maximum number of FTs to force to have (format is (GW, state)). For example, `"force_ft_state_ub":[[4,4], [7,3]]` will force solver to have at most 4 FTs in GW4, and 3 FTs in GW7
  - `randomized`: `true` or `false` - whether you would like to add random noise to EV
  - `randomization_seed`: a seed to use for the random noise. When null, uses a different seed every time. Setting a value allows repeatable random noise across multiple solves
  - `randomization_strength`: a multiplier to use for the generated random noise, defaults to 1.
  - `xmin_lb`: cut-off for dropping players below this many expected minutes across the horizon
  - `ev_per_price_cutoff`: cut-off percentile for dropping players based on total EV per price (e.g. `20` means drop players below 20% percentile)
  - `keep_top_ev_percent`: keeps the top n% of players by total EV in the CSV file. (e.g. `20` means it will keep the 20% highest projected points scorers)
  - `banned`: list of player IDs to be banned over the entire horizon
  - `banned_next_gw`: list of player IDs to be banned for the next gameweek. Alternatively, you can supply an `[ID, gameweek]` list as an element of the list to ban a player just for one specific gameweek. E.g. `[100, [200, 32]]` bans player with ID 100 for the next gameweek, and bans player with ID 200 for gameweek 32
  - `locked`: list of player IDs to always have during the horizon (e.g. `233` for Salah)
  - `locked_next_gw`: List of player IDs to force just for the next gameweek. See `banned_next_gw` for extended usage
  - `keep`: list of player IDs that will be forced to be kept in the player pool, even if otherwise excluded by another filtering option
  - `price_changes`: Supply a list of `[ID, price_change]` pairs to solve as if a player's price has risen or dropped compared to the live price. E.g. `[[311, 1], [351, -1]]` will solve as if Alexander-Arnold's price is £0.1m higher, and Haaland's price is £0.1m lower than it is in reality.
  - `delete_tmp`: `true` or `false` whether to delete generated temporary files after solve
  - `secs`: time limit for the solve (in seconds)
  - `gap`: the relative gap to the upper bound of the optimal solution that the solver will terminate at. Set to 0 if you want to solve to optimality.
  - `num_transfers`: fixed number of transfers for this GW
  - `hit_limit`: limit on total hits can be taken by the solver for entire horizon
  - `weekly_hit_limit`: limit on hits solver can take in a single GW
  - `hit_cost`: cost of a hit, 4 points by default but can be overriden to reduce hits suggested
  - `use_wc`: list of GWs to use wildcard
  - `use_bb`: list of GWs to use bench boost
  - `use_fh`: list of GWs to use free hit
  - `use_tc`: list of GWs to use triple captain
  - `chip_limits`: how many chips of each kind can be used by solver. If using use_wc, e.g., this gets automatically overridden so can be ignored. Can set it to "bb": 1 if you want to use a bb somewhere in the horizon but you don't know where
  - `no_chip_gws`: list of GWs to ban solver from using a chip
  - `allowed_chip_gws`: dictionary of list of GWs to allow chips to be used. For example, `"allowed_chip_gws": {"wc": [27,31]}` will allow solver to use WC in GW27 and GW31, but not in another GW
  - `forced_chip_gws`: dictionary of list of GWs to force chips to be used. Instead of 'allowing' chips, it makes sure that chips are used
  - `future_transfer_limit`: upper bound of how many transfers are allowed in future GWs
  - `no_transfer_gws`: list of GW numbers where transfers are not allowed
  - `booked_transfers`: list of booked transfers for future gameweeks, needs to have a `gw` key and at least one of `transfer_in` or `transfer_out` with the player ID. For example, to book a transfer of buying Kane (427) on GW5 and selling him on GW7, use `"booked_transfers": [{"gw": 5, "transfer_in": 427}, {"gw": 7, "transfer_out": 427}]`
  - `only_booked_transfers`: (for next GW) use only booked transfers
  - `no_trs_except_wc`: when `true` prevents solver from making transfers except using wildcard
  - `preseason`: solve flag for GW1 where team data is not important
  - `no_opposing_play`: controls the level of cross-playing players in the lineup
    - `true` if you do not want to have players in your lineup playing against each other in a GW
    - `false` if you do not want to use this option
    - `"penalty"` if you want to penalize each instance with a static value
  - `opposing_play_group`: `all` if you do not want any type of opposing players or `position` if you only don't want your offense playing against your defense
  - `opposing_play_penalty`: if `"penalty"` is chosen in `no_opposing_play` option, this penalty is deducted from the objective for each cross-play
  - `pick_prices`: price points of players you want to force in a comma separated string. For example, to force two 11.5M forwards, and one 8M midfielder, use `"pick_prices": {"G": "", "D": "", "M": "8", "F": "11.5,11.5"}`
  - `no_gk_rotation_after`: use same lineup GK after given GW, e.g. setting this value to `26` means all GWs after 26 will use same lineup GK
  - `max_defenders_per_team`: the maximum number of defenders and goalkeepers from one team in your squad, defaults to 3
  - `double_defense_pick`: forces solver to use either 0 or 2+ defender/goalkeeper from each team
  - `transfer_itb_buffer`: minimum itb to have if any transfer is being planned for the GW to ensure robustness. For example, use `"transfer_itb_buffer": 0.1` if you want to leave 0.1 in the bank in gameweeks with scheduled transfers
  - `num_iterations`: number of different solutions to be generated, the criteria is controlled by `iteration_criteria`
  - `iteration_criteria`: rule on separating what a different solution mean
    - `this_gw_transfer_in` will force to replace players to buy current GW in each solution
    - `this_gw_transfer_out` will force to replace players to sell current GW in each solution
    - `this_gw_transfer_in_out` will force to replace players to buy or sell current GW in each solution

  - `iteration_difference`: number of players to be different (only available for `this_gw_lineup` criteria for now)
  - `iteration_target`: list of GWs where plans will be forced to replace in each iteration
  - `report_decay_base`: list of decay bases to be measured and reported at the end of the solve
  - `datasource` : specifies the projection data to be used. The value should either be "mixed" or the same name as your CSV file, e.g. if you are using "solio.csv", the value or datasource should be "solio"
  - `data_weights`: weight percentage for each data source, given as a dictionary, where keys should be one valid data sources
  - `export_data`: option for exporting final data as a CSV file (when using `mixed` data)
  - `team_data`: option for using `team_id` value rather than the `team.json` file. Uses `team.json` by default, set value to `ID` to use `team_id`. Note that with this method, any transfers already made this gameweek won't be taken into account, so they must be added to `booked_transfers`
  - `team_id`: the team_id to optimise for. Requires `team_data` to be set to `ID`
  - `team_json`: additional method of supplying your team json to the solver instead of creating a team.json file. Requires `"team_data": "json"` and can be run like `uv run python solve.py --team_json '{"picks": [{...}]}'`. If this is supplied, it overrides the data in team.json
  - `export_image`: option for exporting visualizations of the lineup

  - `verbose`: whether you want to highs solving progress printed to the screen
  - `print_result_table`: whether you want the result table printed to the screen after the solve has finished (the table with iter,buy,sell, chip, score columns)

  - `print_squads`: whether you want the lineup and bench printed for each gameweek in your solution.
  - `dataframe_format`: which [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/]) table format you want result_table and decay_metrics dataframes to be printed with, e.g. "rounded_grid" or "fancy_outline"
  - `hide_transers`: whether you want to hide the transfers in the result_table. Useful if on wildcard or in preseason
  - `solutions_file`: if you supply a string ending in ".csv", it will save your solutions to that csv, including chips, transfers, captain, score, etc.
  - `save_squads`: whether you want each solution in the solutions_file to contain the lineup and bench information for every gameweek
  - `solutions_file_player_type`: "id" or "name", depending on whether you want your solutions file to contain player ids or names when showing results
